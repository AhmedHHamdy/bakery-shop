# Bakery Shop Website 🍰

This is a frontend project I built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It’s all about the design no backend yet, just a pretty and functional website. I was super inspired by [Gabriella Gading](https://dribbble.com/shots/19601688-Cupcaked-Neobrutalism-Web-Design-for-a-Bakery)'s design style.

## What’s Inside? 🎯

- **Home Page**: A cozy landing page to welcome you to the bakery.
- **Login & Register**: Simple forms for users to sign in or create an account (just frontend, no real backend stuff).
- **Contact Me**: A neat little form to get in touch with the bakery.
- **Shop Page**: A place to browse all the yummy bakery items. It’s got:
  - **Filters**: You can filter items by category, price, or whatever you like.
  - **Mock Data**: Fake data for now, but it looks real! Each item has a name, price, description, and image.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on your phone, tablet, or computer.

## Design Vibes 🎨

The design is heavily inspired by [Gabriella Gading](https://dribbble.com/shots/19601688-Cupcaked-Neobrutalism-Web-Design-for-a-Bakery) I’m a huge fan of their work! I focused on making everything look clean and polished, with nice typography, spacing, and colors. It’s all about that visual appeal.

## Tech Stuff 🛠️

- **Next.js**: For building the site (it’s a React framework).
- **TypeScript**: To keep the code clean and less buggy.
